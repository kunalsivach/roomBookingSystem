# roomBookingSystem
 Using this system, customer will be able to see the price and availability of the rooms based on the date and will be able to book the room in the hotel after signing in. There will be two user accounts - admin and customers. Admin will be able to look at the details of the customers, see the booked and vacant rooms in the hotel. Admin can also change the contact details of the hotel . Admin will have the access to add other admins to the system. I have used react, spring boot and sql for this project.
